By this order, we propose to dispose of Civil Writ Petition Nos. 1710/2002 and 1719/2002. These\\r\\nWrit Petitions raise common questions of fact and law. The facts lie in a narrow compass\\r\\n2. The short point involved in these petitions is; whether the Chief Justice o his nominee can\\r\\nremove the named arbitrator and appoint an independent arbitrator, secondly whether when one\\r\\nparty has appointed an arbitrator-though beyond the period stipulated in the Act, the Chief Justice\\r\\nor his nominee could, when approached by the other party, appoint another (sole) arbitrator?\\r\\n3. In order to answer the same we may have quick glance to the of this case. Respondent No. 1 M/s\\r\\nKiran Construction Company was awarded construction of civil and structural works by the\\r\\npetitioner for its plant building and pump foundation for Indian Oil Corporation, Bhatinda Oil\\r\\nTerminal. The said agreement contained an arbitration clause with clear stipulation that in case of\\r\\ndispute the named arbitrator or his nominee will adjudicate the dispute between the parties. Dispute\\r\\narose between the parties. Accordingly respondent No. 1 approached the named Arbitrator on 6th\\r\\nJuly, 1998 for entering upon reference in terms of the arbitration clause: The petitioner vide its\\r\\nletter dated 2oth October, 1999 requested the respondent herein to specify the points of dispute:\\r\\nThe respondent No. 1 enumerated the dispute vide its letter dated 4th December, 1999. However,\\r\\nwhen the named arbitrator did not enter upon the reference nor nominated any Arbitrator, the\\r\\nrespondent No. 1 filed a petition under Sub-section (6) of Section 11 the Arbitration and Conciliation\\r\\nAct, 1996 (in short the Act) While the proceedings were pending before the learned single Judge,\\r\\nthe named Arbitrator nominated Shri C. Ramachandran, Dy. General Manager (HR) of Indian Oil\\r\\nCorporation on 4th April, 2000 as the sole Arbitrator to adjudicate upon the disputes raised by the\\r\\nrespondent No. 1 The said Shri C. Ramachandran, the sole arbitrator entered upon the reference on\\r\\n28th April, 2000. He issued notices to the parties and directed the respondent No. 1 to file its\\r\\nstatement of claim. The fact of appointment of Shri C. Ramachandran, as the sole Arbitrator; was\\r\\nbrought to the notice of the learned single judge. however, the learned single judge by the impugned\\r\\norder dated 28th September, 2001 held that since the appointment of Shri C. Ramachandran was\\r\\nmade after the expiry of 30 days, hence, the petitioner lost its right to appoint an Arbitrator:\\r\\nAccordingly the learned single judge vide the impugned order appointed a former Judge of this High\\r\\nCourt as the sole arbitrator: The Arbitrator so appointed by the learned single judge entered upon\\r\\nthe reference on gth November, 2001. He also issued notices to the parties. Aggrieved by the\\r\\nimpugned order dated 28th September, 2001 this writ petition has been preferred.\\r\\n4. Mr. V.P. Chaudhary, Senior Advocate appearing for the has challenged the impugned order\\r\\nprimarily on the grounds that (i) per the arbitration agreement clause No. 18 the power to nominate\\r\\nthe arbitrator solely vested with the Managing Director, Marketing Division: That in term of Clause\\r\\n18 of the agreement no person other than the Managing Director or his nominee could act as\\r\\nIndian Kanoon - http:Ilindiankanoon.org/doc/692921/',\n",

A formal contract was entered into between the parties on 3rd May 1995.\\r\\nAccording to IOCL; ECIL failed to carry out the work in accordance with the contract despite\\r\\nrepeated warnings. By December 1995 the Respondent had completed the work of a value of\\r\\napproximately Rs.91 lakhs against the job of the value of Rs. 3.25 crores on the fronts that were\\r\\nmade available to it. It was apparent to IOCL, therefore, that ECIL would be unable to complete the\\r\\nwork within the stipulated time. According to IOCL, in order to save time it decided to offload the\\r\\nbalance part of the contractual scope of work and award it to another contractor in exercise of the\\r\\nrights vested in IOCL under Clause 4.6.4.0 of the General Clauses of Contract (GCC').

The area where residential premises were to be\\r\\nconstructed was densely populated and was congested with dwelling units of an informal nature\\r\\nThe two phase programme of work was to be in accordance with the availability of vacant space for\\r\\nthe construction of buildings. The contractor was to initially complete three O four buildings and\\r\\nupon the shifting of project affected families in the space which would be vacated, other buildings\\r\\nwere to be constructed. The contractor was on notice that he would have to coCrdinate the work in\\r\\nsuch a manner as would avoid any hindrance in progress of the work \"for which he would not be\\r\\npaid any additional sum\\'\\r\\nThe contention of the Petitioner is that offers were invited on a lump sum\\r\\nbasis for the entire work without adjustments.\\r\\n2.

From the orders passed under Section 34 of the Act, appeal lies in the Court under Section 37 of\\r\\nthe Act provided such order falls under the category of orders specified thereunder: The order\\r\\nimpugned has been passed refusing to set aside the arbitral award, therefore, it falls within the\\r\\ncategory of such orders and as such, we find that the same is appealable under Section 37(1)(b) of\\r\\nthe Act:\\r\\n4. The fact in brief is that the appellant wanted to construct houses and develop colonies in the city\\r\\nof Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh: It had to construct 24 meters wide road at Ram Ganga Vihar Phase II,\\r\\nMoradabad and in that respect the offer of the respondent was accepted and the agreement was duly\\r\\nexecuted between themselves. According to the appellant; the work was not done by the respondent\\r\\nto their satisfaction. Therefore, the dispute arose\\r\\n5. The respondent filed civil suit; being 0.S. No. 305 of 1998 in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior\\r\\nDivision), Moradabad. In the suit, the appellant filed an application under Sections 5 & 8 of the Act\\r\\nfor the purpose of resolving the dispute with the intervention of the Arbitrator: Such application was\\r\\ndismissed. The appellant made revisional application before the High Court whereunder the\\r\\nproceeding in the suit was stayed. The respondent requested the appellant to resolve the dispute\\r\\nthrough the Arbitrator during the pendency of the suit, when the appellant gave its consent by\\r\\nforwarding a list of Arbitrators The respondent gave his consent to the name of one such person,\\r\\nnamed in the list: Therefore, by consent of the parties, such person was appointed as sole Arbitrator\\r\\nfor the purpose of resolving the dispute between the parties.\\r\\n6. Parties have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator: All the points as raised by the parties\\r\\nhad been considered by the Arbitrator followed by the impugned award\\r\\n7.\\r\\nAccording to the appellant; the award passed by the learned Arbitrator is illegal, unjustified and\\r\\nagainst the principles of natural justice. He had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim of the\\r\\nrespondent: He had to peruse only the file relating to the blacklisting ofthe respondent but he has\\r\\nacted beyond his jurisdiction.

Common questions of law arise for consideration in these cases which shall stand disposed of by\\r\\nthis common order. The respondent Indian Hume Pipe Company Ltd. is engaged in the\\r\\nmanufacture and sale of what is known as \\'PSC Pipes\\' of different specifications. Five different\\r\\ncontracts for the supply of the said pipes including rubber gaskets and M.S. Specials for water\\r\\ntransmission mains were allotted to the respondent company by the Delhi Jal Board (hereafter\\r\\nreferred to as \\'the Board\\') The estimated value of these supplies, as evident from the work orders\\r\\nissued pursuant to the said agreement, was different in each case. The agreements inter alia\\r\\nprovided for adjudication of disputes between the parties by way of arbitration. Disputes having\\r\\narise, the same were referred to a three member arbitral tribunal in terms of similar but separate\\r\\norders all passed by this court on 23rd March, 2001 in Arb.A. Nos. 446/1999,579/1999,290/2000,\\r\\n294/2000,295/2000. The arbitrators have pursuant to the said references, made and published\\r\\ntheir awards, the validity whereof has been challenged by the Board before me in terms of Section 34\\r\\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act; 1996.\\r\\n2\\r\\nAppearing for the Board, Messrs Tewari and Tripathi made a three-fold submission. It was firstly\\r\\nargued by them that the arbitrators had fallen in error in permitting the respondent Company to\\r\\namend its statement of claims so as to add an additional claim to the same. The addition of a claim\\r\\neach in cases relevant to OPM No. 75/2004 and OPM No. 50/2004 was, according to the learned\\r\\ncounsel, neither legally permissible under Section 23(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\\r\\n1996,nor otherwise tenable:\\r\\n3. On behalf of the respondent; it was per contra argued by Mr: Agarwala that the additional claim\\r\\nmade in OMP No. 75/2004 was confined only to refund of a sum of Rs.8,99,348/- which the Board\\r\\nhad admittedly deducted and retained from the running bills of the Company. The fact that this\\r\\namount was lying with the Board but was inadvertently left out of the statement of claim made by\\r\\nthe Company, argued the learned counsel, was sufficient to show that there was no illegality in the\\r\\naddition of the said claim by way of an amendment which the arbitrators were in any case\\r\\ncompetent to grant: It was also contended that the only other addition that was made by the\\r\\nrespondent Company was a claim for payment of interest for the pre-reference period amounting to\\r\\nRs. 9,27,649.99 in the reference relevant to OMP No. 50/2004 Here again, the arbitrators had,\\r\\nwhile considering the claims, declined interest for the pre-reference period although the same\\r\\nshould have been awarded in favor of the Company. There was, according to Mr. Agarwala, no\\r\\nillegality in allowing the amendment of the claims to the extent indicated above, especially when the\\r\\nBoard had the fullest opportunity to contest the said additional claims also on their merits.\\r\\n4. The orders of reference passed by this court in AAs No. 295/2000 and 294/2000 relevant to\\r\\nOMPs No. 50/2004 and 75/2004 did not limit the reference to any particular claim O claims The\\r\\norders passed in both the cases were wide enough and referred to the arbitrators \"the disputes\\r\\nIndian Kanoon - http:Ilindiankanoon.org/doc/20288/',\n",

ADMIT.\\r\\n2. This\\r\\nappeal is directed against the judgment of the Additional District Judge whereby the\\r\\nobjections of the appellant to the award of the Arbitrator were dismissed and the award was made a\\r\\nrule' of the Court and decree in terms thereof was passed:\\r\\n3. Learned counsel for the appellant has raised two points to challenge the award, namely, (i) that\\r\\nunder Clause 25 of the Arbitration Agreement in case a claim was not made within 90 days of the\\r\\nintimation from the Government that final bill was ready for payment; the claim of the contractor\\r\\nwill be deemed to have been waived and absolutely barred, and (ii) the Arbitrator had no\\r\\njurisdiction to award pendent lite interest and consequently the award of interest by the Arbitrator\\r\\nis against law.\\r\\n4. In my view, none of the two grounds on which the award has been challenged can be sustained.\\r\\nThe Arbitrator has clearly held in the award that the final bill was ready only on 11.3.1983 and from\\r\\nthis bill a sum of Rs. 15,000/- was withheld and was finally adjusted by the respondent on 1.5.1984.\\r\\nAccording to the Arbitrator, there was thus no finalisation of the final bill till 1.5.1984 and the\\r\\narbitration agreement having been invoked on 26.6.1984, claim was not time barred under Clause\\r\\n25 of the agreement: Not only that the Arbitrator has given a clear finding about the question of\\r\\nlimitation under Clause 25 after perusing the material on record that the claim was not barred by\\r\\ntime but even otherwise he being the sole arbiter of both law and facts this Court will not sit as a\\r\\nCourt of appeal over his findings, even ifthe Court may take a different view of the matter on the\\r\\nsame facts. Even otherwise, Clause 25 of the arbitration agreement limiting the time during which a\\r\\nclaim can be made by a party, in my view, is clearly against public policy and in view of Section 28 of\\r\\nthe Contract Act is void.\\r\\n5. In support of his second contention that the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to award interest,\\r\\nlearned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in where it was\\r\\nheld that the Arbitrator being not a Court had no jurisdiction to award pendent lite interest: This\\r\\njudgment has been overruled by the Supreme Court itself in . Moreover, under Section 2(a) of the\\r\\nInterest Act, the Court includes a Tribunal and an Arbitrator. Since the Court has power to award\\r\\ninterest under Section 34 of the CPC, in my view, the Arbitrator was fully justified in awarding\\r\\npendent lite interest\\r\\n6. In this view of the matter, I do not find any merit in the appeal and the same is, accordingly,\\r\\ndismissed. Interim order passed earlier stands vacated.

The arbitrator eventually came to the conclusion that the appellant DDA had\\r\\ncommitted defaults in the discharge of its obligations under the agreement thereby rendering the\\r\\ntermination of the contract illegal. On that finding, the Learned Arbitrator held the contractor\\r\\nentitled to the refund of a sum of Rs. 1 lac towards security deposit and a sum of Rs. 10,42,136/-\\r\\nrepresenting the balance amount payable to the contractor for the work done by it but not paid.

This is a\\r\\npetition filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (in short the\\r\\nAct) whereby challenge is laid to an award passed by a three-member arbitral tribunal dated\\r\\n11.\\r\\n06.2013. 1.1 It may be noticed at the outset that each of the parties herein appointed their\\r\\nnominee arbitrators, and that; the two nominees thereafter, jointly decided on the appointment of\\r\\nthe presiding arbitrator: It is in this manner that the arbitral tribunal came to be constituted.\\r\\n2. The dispute in the present petition is admittedly related to one singular issue. The issue being:\\r\\nwhether the respondent is entitled to payment towards price adjustment on all items of work\\r\\nreferred to in the Bill of Quantities (in short BOQ). In other words, was the respondent rightly\\r\\nawarded price adjustment in respect of value of permanent works by the arbitral tribunal. It is the\\r\\nrespondent\\'s stand that the price adjustment in terms of clause 70.3 of the Conditions of Particular\\r\\nApplication (in short COPA) would apply only to \"variations\" and \"day works\\'\\r\\n2.1 The arbitral tribunal, after a detailed analysis of the material placed on record and perusal of the\\r\\nterms and conditions of the contract obtaining between the parties, came to the conclusion that\\r\\nwhen clause 70.3 of COPA is read along with clauses of tender and bid data documents, and other\\r\\nrelevant clauses of COPA, the price adjustment is applicable to the entire work comprising of all\\r\\nBOQ items, including variations and day work except where such variations and day work are\\r\\notherwise not subject to price adjustment\\r\\n3.

By this order, we propose to dispose of Civil Writ Petition Nos. 1710/2002 and 1719/2002. These\\r\\nWrit Petitions raise common questions of fact and law. The facts lie in a narrow compass\\r\\n2. The short point involved in these petitions is; whether the Chief Justice o his nominee can\\r\\nremove the named arbitrator and appoint an independent arbitrator, secondly whether when one\\r\\nparty has appointed an arbitrator-though beyond the period stipulated in the Act, the Chief Justice\\r\\nor his nominee could, when approached by the other party, appoint another (sole) arbitrator?\\r\\n3. In order to answer the same we may have quick glance to the of this case. Respondent No. 1 M/s\\r\\nKiran Construction Company was awarded construction of civil and structural works by the\\r\\npetitioner for its plant building and pump foundation for Indian Oil Corporation, Bhatinda Oil\\r\\nTerminal. The said agreement contained an arbitration clause with clear stipulation that in case of\\r\\ndispute the named arbitrator or his nominee will adjudicate the dispute between the parties. Dispute\\r\\narose between the parties. Accordingly respondent No. 1 approached the named Arbitrator on 6th\\r\\nJuly, 1998 for entering upon reference in terms of the arbitration clause: The petitioner vide its\\r\\nletter dated 2oth October, 1999 requested the respondent herein to specify the points of dispute:\\r\\nThe respondent No. 1 enumerated the dispute vide its letter dated 4th December, 1999. However,\\r\\nwhen the named arbitrator did not enter upon the reference nor nominated any Arbitrator, the\\r\\nrespondent No. 1 filed a petition under Sub-section (6) of Section 11 the Arbitration and Conciliation\\r\\nAct, 1996 (in short the Act) While the proceedings were pending before the learned single Judge,\\r\\nthe named Arbitrator nominated Shri C. Ramachandran, Dy. General Manager (HR) of Indian Oil\\r\\nCorporation on 4th April, 2000 as the sole Arbitrator to adjudicate upon the disputes raised by the\\r\\nrespondent No. 1 The said Shri C. Ramachandran, the sole arbitrator entered upon the reference on\\r\\n28th April, 2000. He issued notices to the parties and directed the respondent No. 1 to file its\\r\\nstatement of claim. The fact of appointment of Shri C. Ramachandran, as the sole Arbitrator; was\\r\\nbrought to the notice of the learned single judge. however, the learned single judge by the impugned\\r\\norder dated 28th September, 2001 held that since the appointment of Shri C. Ramachandran was\\r\\nmade after the expiry of 30 days, hence, the petitioner lost its right to appoint an Arbitrator:\\r\\nAccordingly the learned single judge vide the impugned order appointed a former Judge of this High\\r\\nCourt as the sole arbitrator: The Arbitrator so appointed by the learned single judge entered upon\\r\\nthe reference on gth November, 2001. He also issued notices to the parties. Aggrieved by the\\r\\nimpugned order dated 28th September, 2001 this writ petition has been preferred.\\r\\n4. Mr. V.P. Chaudhary, Senior Advocate appearing for the has challenged the impugned order\\r\\nprimarily on the grounds that (i) per the arbitration agreement clause No. 18 the power to nominate\\r\\nthe arbitrator solely vested with the Managing Director, Marketing Division: That in term of Clause\\r\\n18 of the agreement no person other than the Managing Director or his nominee could act as\\r\\nIndian Kanoon - http:Ilindiankanoon.org/doc/692921/',\n",

Before the arbitrator; the respondent contractor made as many as ten claims inclusive\\r\\nof interest and cost ofarbitration while the appellant made a counter claim for payment ofa sum of\\r\\nRs. 40,781/- which was given up in terms of a statement made on behalf of the appellant before the\\r\\narbitrator on 08/9/02. The arbitrator eventually came to the conclusion that the appellant DDA had\\r\\ncommitted defaults in the discharge of its obligations under the agreement thereby rendering the\\r\\ntermination of the contract illegal. On that finding, the Learned Arbitrator held the contractor\\r\\nentitled to the refund of a sum of Rs. 1 lac towards security deposit and a sum of Rs. 10,42,136/-\\r\\nrepresenting the balance amount payable to the contractor for the work done by it but not paid. The\\r\\narbitrator further held the respondent contractor entitled to a sum of Rs. 3,50,000/- towards\\r\\nincrease in the price of materials and a sum of Rs. 1,91,659/- 0n account of increase in the labour\\r\\ncharges. A further sum of Rs. 3,48,563/- was awarded by the arbitrator on account of loss of\\r\\nanticipated profit on the balance of the work which the contractor could not complete on account of\\r\\ntermination. A total sum of Rs. 20,32,358/\\r\\nwas thus awarded by the arbitrator in favor of the\\r\\nrespondent with interest\\r\\n18% per annum from 25/4/87 till realisation with cost: The arbitrator\\r\\ndirected that if the amount awarded by him was paid by the DDA within a period of two months\\r\\nfrom the date of this award, the rate of interest would stand reduced to 12% per annum for the entire\\r\\nperiod mentioned above:\\r\\n3.

During the course of the work, the Respondent raised claims\\r\\ninter alia towards loss of overheads, increases in costs, underChtilization of machinery, refund of\\r\\nexcise duties, increase in steel and cement prices and compound interest: The Engineer appointed\\r\\nunder the contract refused to certify the claims of the Respondent by a letter dated 13th July 2004.\\r\\nClause 24 of the agreement stipulated that in the event that a decision taken by the Engineer was\\r\\noutside the authority conferred by the contract or was wrong, the decision was to be referred to an\\r\\nadjudicator. In the meantime, the Respondent continued to raise bills including claims for the\\r\\naforesaid amount, a practice which was followed from R.A Bill 3 which was submitted on 24th\\r\\nAugust 2004 upto RA. Bill 9 submitted on 24th February 2005. The Adjudicator was required to\\r\\ntake a decision within 28 days. The Respondent referred the dispute to the Adjudicator on 3rd\\r\\nSeptember 2004. On 27th October 2004, the Respondent invoked arbitration under the arbitral\\r\\nprovisions contained in Clause 25.2 of the contract, principally on the basis that the Adjudicator had\\r\\nfailed to render a decision within the stipulated period. The Adjudicator was thereupon informed in\\r\\na\\r\\nmeeting held on 16th March 2005 that the Respondent did not desire to continue with\\r\\nadjudication for those claims which were referred to arbitration:\\r\\nSubsequent claims were referred by the Respondent to the Adjudicator on 7th March 2005. The\\r\\nAdjudicator held that the Respondent was entitled to an extension of time without levy of liquidated\\r\\ndamages until 26th April 2005. The Engineer had by a letter dated 27th December 2004 imposed\\r\\nliquidated damages on the Respondent on account of delay in the completion of work under Phase I\\r\\nand declined to grant an extension of time. On 1oth January 2005,the Respondent addressed a\\r\\ncommunication to the Petitioner recording therein that the Petitioner was not responsible for the\\r\\ndelay in the completion of work under what was described as Mile StoneDI and sought an extension\\r\\nof time for completion without levy of liquidated damages The Respondent undertook that on\\r\\nIndian Kanoon - http:Ilindiankanoon.org/doc/807022/',\n",

The facts in brief of the present case, is that, a notice inviting tender was issued by the appellant\\r\\nauthority for extension of \"Extension Passenger Terminal of Guwahati Airport; SH : Civil Works\\r\\nincluding Plumbing\\'\\r\\nThe work was awarded to the respondent on 26.03.1993 for Rs.\\r\\n7,35,05,712.00. As per condition of contract, the work consisted of 3 phases, each phase was to be\\r\\ncompleted in 7 months and the entire job was to be completed within 21 months with the date of\\r\\nstarting as 10.04.1994. The appellant authority on 29.08.1994 terminated the contract on the\\r\\nground of failure of the respondent no. 2 to complete the 1st phase of the work within the stipulated\\r\\nperiod of 7 months\\' time. Against the said order of termination of said contract the\\r\\nrespondent-contractor approached this Court in Civil Rule No 3959/94 and this Court vide order\\r\\ndated 27.09.1994 quashed the order of termination of work dated 29.08.1994 and directed the\\r\\nrespondent No. 1 to allow the contractor time up to the end of January 1995 for completion of 1st\\r\\nphase of the work. This Court further observed that in case the respondent-contractor is unable to\\r\\ncomplete the 1st phase of the work for any reason by the end of January 1995, they may approach for\\r\\nextension of time. Extension of time for completion of the work was thereafter provisionaly granted\\r\\nwithout prejudice to the right of the authority to recover liquidated damages in accordance with the\\r\\nprovisions of Clause 2 of the contract agreement to keep the agreement alive and further stipulated\\r\\nthat the time still continue to be the essence of the contract: Since the work could not be completed\\r\\nby the respondent-contractor; a show cause notice dated 18.02.1996 was issued by the Executive\\r\\nEngineer under Clause 3 of the terms of the contract asking the respondent-contractor to show\\r\\ncause within 10 days as to why action under Clauses 3(a), 3(b) and/or 3(c) of the agreement shall\\r\\nnot be taken against it o account of breach of contract on their part.

Ltd. on 11 March, 2005\\r\\nAuthor: T Thakur\\r\\nBench: TThakur\\r\\nJUDGMENT T.S. Thakur, J.\\r\\n1. Common questions of law arise for consideration in these cases which shall stand disposed of by\\r\\nthis common order. The respondent Indian Hume Pipe Company Ltd. is engaged in the\\r\\nmanufacture and sale of what is known as \\'PSC Pipes\\' of different specifications. Five different\\r\\ncontracts for the supply of the said pipes including rubber gaskets and M.S. Specials for water\\r\\ntransmission mains were allotted to the respondent company by the Delhi Jal Board (hereafter\\r\\nreferred to as \\'the Board\\') The estimated value of these supplies, as evident from the work orders\\r\\nissued pursuant to the said agreement, was different in each case. The agreements inter alia\\r\\nprovided for adjudication of disputes between the parties by way of arbitration. Disputes having\\r\\narise, the same were referred to a three member arbitral tribunal in terms of similar but separate\\r\\norders all passed by this court on 23rd March, 2001 in Arb.A. Nos. 446/1999,579/1999,290/2000,\\r\\n294/2000,295/2000. The arbitrators have pursuant to the said references, made and published\\r\\ntheir awards, the validity whereof has been challenged by the Board before me in terms of Section 34\\r\\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act; 1996.\\r\\n2\\r\\nAppearing for the Board, Messrs Tewari and Tripathi made a three-fold submission. It was firstly\\r\\nargued by them that the arbitrators had fallen in error in permitting the respondent Company to\\r\\namend its statement of claims so as to add an additional claim to the same. The addition of a claim\\r\\neach in cases relevant to OPM No. 75/2004 and OPM No. 50/2004 was, according to the learned\\r\\ncounsel, neither legally permissible under Section 23(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\\r\\n1996,nor otherwise tenable:\\r\\n3. On behalf of the respondent; it was per contra argued by Mr: Agarwala that the additional claim\\r\\nmade in OMP No. 75/2004 was confined only to refund of a sum of Rs.8,99,348/- which the Board\\r\\nhad admittedly deducted and retained from the running bills of the Company. The fact that this\\r\\namount was lying with the Board but was inadvertently left out of the statement of claim made by\\r\\nthe Company, argued the learned counsel, was sufficient to show that there was no illegality in the\\r\\naddition of the said claim by way of an amendment which the arbitrators were in any case\\r\\ncompetent to grant: It was also contended that the only other addition that was made by the\\r\\nrespondent Company was a claim for payment of interest for the pre-reference period amounting to\\r\\nRs. 9,27,649.99 in the reference relevant to OMP No. 50/2004 Here again, the arbitrators had,\\r\\nwhile considering the claims, declined interest for the pre-reference period although the same\\r\\nshould have been awarded in favor of the Company. There was, according to Mr. Agarwala, no\\r\\nillegality in allowing the amendment of the claims to the extent indicated above, especially when the\\r\\nBoard had the fullest opportunity to contest the said additional claims also on their merits.\\r\\n4. The orders of reference passed by this court in AAs No. 295/2000 and 294/2000 relevant to\\r\\nOMPs No. 50/2004 and 75/2004 did not limit the reference to any particular claim O claims The\\r\\norders passed in both the cases were wide enough and referred to the arbitrators \"the disputes\\r\\nIndian Kanoon - http:Ilindiankanoon.org/doc/20288/',\n",

ADMIT.\\r\\n2. This\\r\\nappeal is directed against the judgment of the Additional District Judge whereby the\\r\\nobjections of the appellant to the award of the Arbitrator were dismissed and the award was made a\\r\\nrule' of the Court and decree in terms thereof was passed:\\r\\n3. Learned counsel for the appellant has raised two points to challenge the award, namely, (i) that\\r\\nunder Clause 25 of the Arbitration Agreement in case a claim was not made within 90 days of the\\r\\nintimation from the Government that final bill was ready for payment; the claim of the contractor\\r\\nwill be deemed to have been waived and absolutely barred, and (ii) the Arbitrator had no\\r\\njurisdiction to award pendent lite interest and consequently the award of interest by the Arbitrator\\r\\nis against law.\\r\\n4. In my view, none of the two grounds on which the award has been challenged can be sustained.\\r\\nThe Arbitrator has clearly held in the award that the final bill was ready only on 11.3.1983 and from\\r\\nthis bill a sum of Rs. 15,000/- was withheld and was finally adjusted by the respondent on 1.5.1984.\\r\\nAccording to the Arbitrator, there was thus no finalisation of the final bill till 1.5.1984 and the\\r\\narbitration agreement having been invoked on 26.6.1984, claim was not time barred under Clause\\r\\n25 of the agreement: Not only that the Arbitrator has given a clear finding about the question of\\r\\nlimitation under Clause 25 after perusing the material on record that the claim was not barred by\\r\\ntime but even otherwise he being the sole arbiter of both law and facts this Court will not sit as a\\r\\nCourt of appeal over his findings, even ifthe Court may take a different view of the matter on the\\r\\nsame facts. Even otherwise, Clause 25 of the arbitration agreement limiting the time during which a\\r\\nclaim can be made by a party, in my view, is clearly against public policy and in view of Section 28 of\\r\\nthe Contract Act is void.\\r\\n5. In support of his second contention that the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to award interest,\\r\\nlearned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in where it was\\r\\nheld that the Arbitrator being not a Court had no jurisdiction to award pendent lite interest: This\\r\\njudgment has been overruled by the Supreme Court itself in . Moreover, under Section 2(a) of the\\r\\nInterest Act, the Court includes a Tribunal and an Arbitrator. Since the Court has power to award\\r\\ninterest under Section 34 of the CPC, in my view, the Arbitrator was fully justified in awarding\\r\\npendent lite interest\\r\\n6. In this view of the matter, I do not find any merit in the appeal and the same is, accordingly,\\r\\ndismissed. Interim order passed earlier stands vacated.

The dispute in the present petition is admittedly related to one singular issue. The issue being:\\r\\nwhether the respondent is entitled to payment towards price adjustment on all items of work\\r\\nreferred to in the Bill of Quantities (in short BOQ). In other words, was the respondent rightly\\r\\nawarded price adjustment in respect of value of permanent works by the arbitral tribunal. It is the\\r\\nrespondent\\'s stand that the price adjustment in terms of clause 70.3 of the Conditions of Particular\\r\\nApplication (in short COPA) would apply only to \"variations\" and \"day works\\'\\r\\n2.1 The arbitral tribunal, after a detailed analysis of the material placed on record and perusal of the\\r\\nterms and conditions of the contract obtaining between the parties, came to the conclusion that\\r\\nwhen clause 70.3 of COPA is read along with clauses of tender and bid data documents, and other\\r\\nrelevant clauses of COPA, the price adjustment is applicable to the entire work comprising of all\\r\\nBOQ items, including variations and day work except where such variations and day work are\\r\\notherwise not subject to price adjustment\\r\\n3.

Indian Oil Corporation Limited ('IOCL') in this petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and\\r\\nConciliation Act; 1996 ('Act') has challenged an Award dated 15th January 2006 of the learned sole\\r\\nArbitrator in the disputes between it and the Respondent, Era Constructions (India) Limited\\r\\n('ECIL') arising out of the award of civil and structural works for IOCL's Catalytic Reformer Unit\\r\\n('CRU'), Utilities and Off-sites at Mathura Refinery, to ECIL by IOCL by a telegram of Acceptance\\r\\ndated 4th January 1995 followed by a Letter of Acceptance ('LOA') dated 22nd February 1995. By\\r\\nthe impugned Award, the learned Arbitrator rejected IOCL's claims as being time barred and\\r\\nallowed ECL's counter claims in part:\\r\\nBackground facts\\r\\n2. In terms of the LOA the work was to be completed within 12 months to be reckoned from the date\\r\\nof issue of the LOA. A formal contract was entered into between the parties on 3rd May 1995.\\r\\nAccording to IOCL; ECIL failed to carry out the work in accordance with the contract despite\\r\\nrepeated warnings. By December 1995 the Respondent had completed the work of a value of\\r\\napproximately Rs.91 lakhs against the job of the value of Rs. 3.25 crores on the fronts that were\\r\\nmade available to it. It was apparent to IOCL, therefore, that ECIL would be unable to complete the\\r\\nwork within the stipulated time. According to IOCL, in order to save time it decided to offload the\\r\\nbalance part of the contractual scope of work and award it to another contractor in exercise of the\\r\\nrights vested in IOCL under Clause 4.6.4.0 of the General Clauses of Contract (GCC'). IOCL issued a\\r\\nshow cause notice dated Sth December 1995 to ECIL as to why the remaining scope of the work\\r\\nshould not be offloaded to the another contractor at the risk and cost of ECIL in terms of Clause\\r\\nIndian Kanoon - http:Ilindiankanoon org/doc/135989955/\",\n",

This is a</br>petition filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996 (in short the</br>Act) whereby challenge is laid to an award passed by a three-member arbitral tribunal dated</br>11.</br>06.2013. 1.1 It may be noticed at the outset that each of the parties herein appointed their</br>nominee arbitrators, and that; the two nominees thereafter, jointly decided on the appointment of</br>the presiding arbitrator: It is in this manner that the arbitral tribunal came to be constituted.</br>2. The dispute in the present petition is admittedly related to one singular issue. The issue being:</br>whether the respondent is entitled to payment towards price adjustment on all items of work</br>referred to in the Bill of Quantities (in short BOQ). In other words, was the respondent rightly</br>awarded price adjustment in respect of value of permanent works by the arbitral tribunal. It is the</br>respondent's stand that the price adjustment in terms of clause 70.3 of the Conditions of Particular</br>Application (in short COPA) would apply only to &quot;variations&quot; and &quot;day works'</br>2.1 The arbitral tribunal, after a detailed analysis of the material placed on record and perusal of the</br>terms and conditions of the contract obtaining between the parties, came to the conclusion that</br>when clause 70.3 of COPA is read along with clauses of tender and bid data documents, and other</br>relevant clauses of COPA, the price adjustment is applicable to the entire work comprising of all</br>BOQ items, including variations and day work except where such variations and day work are</br>otherwise not subject to price adjustment</br>3. The brief facts which are required to be noticed for the disposal of the present petition are as</br>follows:</br>Indian Kanoon - http:Ilindiankanoon.org/doc/9741462/</br></div></span>"
